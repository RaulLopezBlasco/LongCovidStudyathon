Lead: [@xjq8065524](https://github.com/xjq8065524)

## Objective
**To understand the epidemiology of PASC and long COVID-19**
### Specific objectives:
- To estimate incidence and prevalence of PASC and long COVID relevant conditions in different COVID-19 (first infection, new infection and reinfection cohorts) and other comparison cohorts (test negative and influenza cohorts).
- To study the variations of epidemiology of long COVID and PASC across different European populations, healthcare settings, and periods/stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
